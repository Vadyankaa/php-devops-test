# Simple File Manager 🗄️

A lightweight web‑based file manager for browsing directories, uploading/downloading files, and performing basic file operations (create, rename, delete, copy).

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Volumes**: Modify the `volumes:` section in `compose.yaml` to map your host directory to the container’s file‑store directory.  
- **Ports**: By default you’ll map host port → container port (e.g., `80:80`), but you can change this to any free port.  
- **Persistent data**: Ensure your mapped directory is preserved across container restarts to keep your files safe.
